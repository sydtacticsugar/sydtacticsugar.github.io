I was the "shy kid" who knew the answer, but couldn't bear to raise her hand for fear of embarrassment. My friends and colleagues don't believe me when I tell them of my childhood, in which I was <a href="https://www.asha.org/public/speech/disorders/Selective-Mutism/">mute</a> (due to something called <a href="https://www.selectivemutism.org/what-is-sm/">Selective Mutism</a>) for over 15 years. However, that quiet, scared, little girl broke out of her shell years ago and hasn't looked back since.

Today I am the proud graduate of an improvisational comedy conservatory and have been working in customer-facing roles for the past several years. I don't bat an eye in high-pressure situations and my nightmares are more likely to involve horror movie tropes than public speaking scenarios.
